**Thronglets** is an open source toolkit designed to assist engineering teams in systematically breaking down and decoupling monolithic applications into modular, scalable services. Whether you're targeting microservices, modular monoliths, or service-oriented architectures, Thronglets provides a set of practical tools and patterns to analyze dependencies, extract business domains, and incrementally refactor legacy codebases with minimal risk.

Built on top of [Temporal](https://temporal.io) to orchestrate long-running workflows and service boundaries, Thronglets seamlessly integrates with existing **Ruby on Rails** applications, making it ideal for teams modernizing legacy Rails monoliths.
